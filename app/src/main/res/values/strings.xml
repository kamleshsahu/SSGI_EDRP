    Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing,
        if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project.
    Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years.
        Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.
    Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help.
        The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.
     all of our open source work is public,
        which means you can modify the project as well as help us for making our app better.</string>
